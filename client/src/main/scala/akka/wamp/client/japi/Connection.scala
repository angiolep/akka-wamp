/**
  * Represents a connection established by a client to a router.
  *
  * Instances can be obtained by invoking the '''Client.connect()''' method.
  * {{{
  *   Client client = ...
  *   CompletionStage<Connection> conn =
  *     client.connect("myrouter");
  * }}}
  *
  * Named transports can be configured as follows:
  * {{{
  *   akka.wamp.client.transport {
  *     myrouter {
  *       url = "wss://router.host.net:8443/wamp"
  *       format = "msgpack"
  *       min-backoff = 3 seconds
  *       max-backoff = 30 seconds
  *       random-factor = 0.2
  *     }
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * Once the connection is established you can open a new [[Session]].
  * {{{
  *   CompletionStage<Session> session =
  *     conn.theCompose(c -> c.open("myrealm"));
  * }}}
