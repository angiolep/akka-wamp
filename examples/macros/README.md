# akka-wamp/examples/macros
This example demonstrates you how to write clients using the [Macros](http://angiolep.github.io/projects/akka-wamp/client/macros.html) based API. 

As the client in this example attempt to establish local connections, you're required to run the [examples/router](../router/README.md) first.

## Run

```bash
cd akka-wamp
sbt

example-macros/run
```
