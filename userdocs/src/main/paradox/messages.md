# Messages
AkkaWamp provides you with an object-oriented representation of all of its managed messages.

```scala
import akka.wamp.messages._
```

You'll get classes representing both internal commands/signals and WAMP messages carried over the network transport, such as [Hello](#Hello), [Welcome](#Welcome), [Publish](#Publish), etc. that can be sent to (or received from) Akka actors.

<a name="Abort"></a>

## Abort
It is the message the client receives from the router upon session opening failure. It can be deconstructed with:

* ``details: Dict``  
  It is a dictionary with additional details. It might be empty.
  
* ``reason: Uri``  
  It is the abort reason given as identifier (e.g. ``wamp.error.no_such_realm``)

<a name="CommandFailed"></a>

## CommandFailed
It is the signal the client receives from the [manager actor](./client/index.html#extension-manager) whatever command (e.g. [Connect](#Connect) or [Bind](#Bind)) fails. It can be deconstructed with:

* ``cmd: Command``  
  It is the original command that was failed

* ``ex: Throwable``  
  It is the exception thrown.



<a name="Connect"></a>

## Connect
It's the command message your client application sends to the [manager actor](./client/index.html#extension-manager) to connect to a router. It can be constructed passing the following arguments:

* ``uri: URI``  
  It is the [URL](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt) of the router your client wants to connect to. Akka Wamp supports the following transport protocols:
 
    * ``tcp``  
        Transmission Control Protocol
    * ``tsl``  
        Transport Secure Layer
    * ``ws``  
        WebSocket 
    * ``wss``  
        WebSocket over TLS
        
* ``format: String``  
  It is the format (textual or binary) to be used by connected peers to represent WAMP messages when they are carried over the selected transport. Akka Wamp supports the following formats:
  
    * ``json``  
       (textual) [JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/)
    * ``msgpack``  
       (binary) [Message Pack](http://msgpack.org/)
       
@@@ warning
Though documented here, the actual Akka Wamp version does provide neither ``tcp``, ``tls``, ``wss`` transports nor ``msgpack`` format.
